            Right now I’m a student in the 4th year of the Master in Electrical engineering and computers in IST. My particular interest is in the field of programming, internet and computers. <br><br>I consider myself an autodidact, when i find a new interest or when faced with a problem i try to do my own research  in order to satisfy my need or to solve the problem. I manage to have a healthy and equilibrated life style by exercising regularly and eating properly because it brings both body and mental benefits that make me feel better.<br><br>In my day-to-day i enjoy hanging out with friends,  walking,  arguing ideias and trying new experiences by getting out of the routine. Parallel to this i try to live by doing “good” and help others.
